# Copilot Primitive Standard

`.github/` holds this kit's Copilot **primitives**: agents, prompts, instructions, skills, and hooks. This file is the written, citable standard for how every one of them is structured, so a new primitive can match the existing set without reverse-engineering it. The gold-standard reference the team names is the archaeologist agent ([`archaeologist.agent.md`](agents/archaeologist.agent.md)); the patterns below are derived from it and its peers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The documentation style guide ([`../docs/DOC-STYLE-GUIDE.md`](../docs/DOC-STYLE-GUIDE.md), rule R4) deliberately governs `docs/` and the numbered stage folders **only** — never `.github/`. Copilot primitives follow *this* standard instead, so a documentation pass must not restructure a primitive as prose.

## The harness model

A primitive is one surface of the repository's agent harness. The model used by this team kit is:

```text
Harness = Instructions + Constraints + Feedback + Memory + Evaluation + Governance
```

| Layer | Primitive that carries it |
|---|---|
| Instructions | `copilot-instructions.md`, `instructions/*.instructions.md` |
| Constraints | `hooks/*.json` that block a tool call; instruction `applyTo` scoping |
| Feedback | prompts and agents that run checks and report back |
| Memory | Team-owned ADRs, specifications, tests, and Git history |
| Evaluation | `workflows/spec-quality.yml` plus `scripts/validate-copilot-primitives.py` |
| Governance | this standard, enforced by the `copilot-primitives` CI job |

Prefer updating an existing primitive over adding a near-duplicate one.

The branch's [language metadata](language.json) identifies its edition. The primitive validator recognizes the equivalent Spanish structural headings on `espanol`; translating prose never changes frontmatter schemas or machine identifiers.

## Rules that apply to every primitive

### Markdown and style

- [ ] English on `main` and `develop`; Brazilian Portuguese on `portugues-br`; Spanish on `espanol`, including primitive prose. Follow the [repository language policy](../README.md#repository-languages), preserving paths, identifiers, and schemas. No emojis; convey NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, and CAUTION with GFM alerts such as `> [!NOTE]`.
- [ ] Exactly one H1 (`#`) per file — the document title, below the frontmatter. The primitive validator enforces this; markdownlint's MD025 (multiple top-level headings) is disabled.
- [ ] The blank line between the closing `---` and the H1 is optional, and both forms lint clean: agents, prompts, and skills omit it, while the instruction files keep one. MD022 does not fire on the frontmatter boundary and is not overridden, so match the sibling files in the same directory rather than forcing a churn-only diff.
- [ ] Never skip a heading level; go `#`, then `##`, then `###`.
- [ ] Every fenced code block declares a language (for example `java`, `json`, `text`, or `bash`) — a house convention upheld in review, since markdownlint's MD040 is disabled.
- [ ] Use real GFM tables (with the `|---|` separator row) whenever there are two or more dimensions, and `- [ ]` checklists for anything the reader must verify.
- [ ] End with exactly one trailing newline. No trailing whitespace, hard tabs, or consecutive blank lines.
- [ ] Never disable a markdownlint rule inline with an HTML comment pragma (failure #2). The root [`../.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`](../.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc) is the only lint config; an inline pragma duplicates it and burns context-window tokens for zero instructional value. The pragmas stripped from 158 files disabled exactly the rules that config already disables — pure redundancy that changed nothing but cost tokens.

### Content and accuracy

- [ ] **Cite the authoritative source for every convention** — do not restate it from the summary in `copilot-instructions.md`. Branch names come from [`../00-GIT-WORKFLOW.md`](../00-GIT-WORKFLOW.md); legacy-reading rules from [`instructions/natural-adabas.instructions.md`](instructions/natural-adabas.instructions.md); EARS and `source_legacy` from [`skills/ears-validate/SKILL.md`](skills/ears-validate/SKILL.md).
- [ ] **Branch prefixes** (authoritative table in [`../00-GIT-WORKFLOW.md`](../00-GIT-WORKFLOW.md)): `spec/<NNN>-<feature>`, `impl/<NNN>-<feature>`, `infra/<component>`, `docs/<topic>`, and `agent/<issue-NN>` — each cut from `develop`. Never collapse `impl/` into `spec/` (failure #1).
- [ ] **Never invent SIFAP facts.** A primitive teaches *how to discover* legacy behavior; it never states what a business rule is. The corpus under `01-archaeology/legacy-sifap/` is 24 Natural members (12 `.NSP`, 5 `.NSN`, 2 `.NSC`, 2 `.NSA`, 1 `.NSL`, 2 `.jcl`), 4 `.ddm` DDMs, and 1 FDT `.txt` listing. No `.NSD` file exists.
- [ ] **Approved toolchain only.** Never recommend, install, or switch to Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Cline, Continue, Aider, Codeium, Tabnine, IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Neovim; VS Code with GitHub Copilot is the only approved editor and assistant.
- [ ] Call the event a workshop, never a `hackathon`.
- [ ] Use the current English paths only; the retired Portuguese directory names are rejected by the validator's stale-path check (failure #5). `backend/` and `frontend/` do **not** exist yet (the team creates them in Stage 3); `infra/` **does** exist.

## Frontmatter by primitive type

Frontmatter is a closed schema per type: an unknown, retired, or invalid key **fails the `copilot-primitives` gate**. Keys marked platform-specific are silently ignored on other surfaces, so they are safe to keep. Quote `name` and `description` string values — the established house convention, currently held by every agent, prompt, instruction, and skill in the kit.

### Agent frontmatter

File: `agents/<id>.agent.md`.

| Key | Notes |
|---|---|
| `name` | Agent id; conventionally present. Renaming an agent silently breaks every prompt that binds to it via `agent:`. |
| `description` | The only key the gate strictly requires. |
| `tools` | For example `[read, search, edit]`; add `execute` or `"github/*"` only when needed. |
| `model` | Optional. |
| `handoffs` | Stage agents only (VS Code only). Persona agents never use it. |
| `target`, `user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`, `metadata`, `agents` | Optional. |
| `mcp-servers` | GitHub.com and CLI only. |
| `argument-hint` | VS Code only. |

The `infer:` key is retired — remove it.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the sequential **Stage** agents carry `handoffs`, and only when a next stage exists: `archaeologist -> architect -> builder` each hand off to the next, while the terminal Stage 4 agent (`evolution`) has none. No persona agent has `handoffs`.

### Prompt frontmatter

File: `prompts/<name>.prompt.md`. The slash-command name derives from the filename unless `name:` overrides it. Valid keys: `name`, `description`, `agent`, `model`, `tools`, `argument-hint`.

- `agent:` must resolve to a built-in (`ask`, `agent`, or `plan`) or a file in `agents/`.
- `mode:` is stale (old chat-mode syntax, superseded by `agent:`) — remove it.
- `tested_with:` is invented and does nothing — remove it.

### Instruction frontmatter

File: `instructions/<name>.instructions.md`. Valid keys: `applyTo`, `name`, `description`, `excludeAgent`.

- Scope `applyTo` to concrete globs. `applyTo: "**"` injects the file into every request and **fails the gate**; many files competing for one path such as `**/*.tf` caused failure #6.

### Repo-wide instructions (`copilot-instructions.md`)

This file takes **no frontmatter** and is injected into every Chat, agent, and code-review request on every surface, so each line carries a recurring token cost. Keep it **at or under 100 lines**.

- Put only **broadly applicable** content here: project context, the target stack, cross-cutting rules, and the strict do-not list. GitHub's guidance is that instructions be "short, self-contained statements."
- **Do not restate language- or path-specific rules.** Path-scoped files exist so you can "avoid overloading your repository-wide instructions"; Java, TypeScript, Terraform, database, and security detail belongs in `instructions/*.instructions.md`, which load automatically for matching paths.
- Keep the **stack declaration** here even though scoped files repeat it: whether `applyTo` matches a directory that does not exist yet is undocumented, and `backend/` and `frontend/` are created only in Stage 3.
- Avoid the documented anti-patterns: directives to go read another document, tool or extension routing, tone mandates, and response-length limits.

### Skill frontmatter

File: `skills/<dir>/SKILL.md`. Only `name` and `description` are valid.

- `name` **must exactly equal the parent directory name** (lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens; 64 characters max) or the skill silently fails to load (failure #4).
- `description` must state **when to use** the skill, because it drives semantic auto-loading, and is capped at 1024 characters.
- `license`, `allowed-tools`, `compatibility`, and `metadata` are **not** in the schema; remove them.

### Hook configuration

A hook is a flat JSON file at `hooks/<name>.json`. A nested `<name>/hooks.json` is **never discovered** and silently never runs (failure #3). The handler script lives in `hooks/<name>/` and must be executable.

- `version` must be `1`; `hooks` maps an event to a list of handlers.
- Events include `sessionStart`, `sessionEnd`, `userPromptSubmitted`, `preToolUse`, and `postToolUse`. A handler `type` is `command`, `http`, or `prompt`.

A `preToolUse` hook blocks a tool call by writing this object to stdout:

```json
{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"..."}
```

## Required body sections

Section structure is machine-checked by `scripts/validate-copilot-primitives.py`. Use these headings, in order.

| Primitive | Required `##` sections, in order |
|---|---|
| Agent | `Mission`, `Lead Personas`, `Operating Principles`, `What This Agent Knows`, `What This Agent Does NOT Know`, `Available Prompts`, a heading ending in `Definition of Done`, `Anti-Patterns This Agent Rejects`, `Spec-Kit Integration` |
| Prompt | `Objective`, `When to Invoke`, `Preconditions`, `Inputs the Team Must Provide`, `What I Will Do`, `What I Will NOT Do`, `Output Format`, optional `Rules from <file>`, `Definition of Done`, `Prompt Body`, `Invocation Example` |
| Instruction | concrete topic sections, then `Conventions`, `Do / Do Not`, `Checklist Before Opening a PR` |
| Skill | `When to invoke`, a substantive procedure section, `Output template`, `Quality gate` |

## Skeletons

Copy a skeleton, keep the frontmatter and section order, then replace every placeholder in angle brackets.

### Agent skeleton

````markdown
---
name: "<agent-id>"
description: "<Stage N or Persona> assistant — one line"
tools: [read, search, edit]
# handoffs:                 # Stage agents only, and only if a next stage exists
#   - label: "Start Stage <N+1>"
#     agent: <next-agent-id>
#     prompt: "<what the next agent does with this stage's artifacts>"
#     send: false
---
# @<agent-id>-agent

## Mission

<What the agent helps the team do, and the boundary it will not cross.>

## Lead Personas

| Role | Involvement |
|------|-----------|
| **<Persona>** | LEAD — <responsibility> |

## Operating Principles

- **<Principle>.** <One or two sentences of judgment or routing.>

## What This Agent Knows

<General, transferable patterns — never system-specific answers.>

## What This Agent Does NOT Know

<Everything that must emerge from the team's own investigation.>

## Available Prompts

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [`/<command>`](../prompts/<file>.prompt.md) | <purpose> |

## Definition of Done

- [ ] <verifiable outcome>

## Anti-Patterns This Agent Rejects

1. **<Anti-pattern>.** <Why it is rejected, and the redirect.>

## Spec-Kit Integration

<Where the agent sits in the /speckit.* flow.>
````

A Stage agent may prefix the last-but-two heading with its stage, for example `## Stage 1 Definition of Done`.

### Prompt skeleton

`## Prompt Body` is plain Markdown addressed to the agent in the second person — never a code fence. Open with a role line such as `You are the @<agent-id>.`, then drive the work with `**Step 1 — ...**`, `**Step 2 — ...**` bold step headers, each followed by bullets.

````markdown
---
name: "<slash-command>"
description: "<one line>"
argument-hint: "<arg=... arg=...>"
agent: "<agent-id>"
tools: ["read", "search", "edit"]
---
# /<slash-command>

## Objective

<The single outcome this prompt produces.>

## When to Invoke

## Preconditions

## Inputs the Team Must Provide

## What I Will Do

## What I Will NOT Do

## Output Format

```markdown
<the exact shape the prompt appends or emits>
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] <verifiable outcome>

## Prompt Body

You are the `@<agent-id>`. <One-line framing of the task.>

**Step 1 — <action>**

- <instruction>

**Step 2 — <action>**

- <instruction>

## Invocation Example

```text
/<slash-command> arg=<value>
```
````

When the prompt depends on an instruction or skill, add an optional `## Rules from <file>` section that inlines the rules you enforce, immediately before `## Definition of Done`.

### Instruction skeleton

````markdown
---
description: "Use when <situation this file scopes>."
applyTo: "<glob>,<glob>"
---

# <Topic> — Guide

<One paragraph: what opens this file, what it covers, and which sibling instruction owns the rest.>

## <Concrete topic>

<Guidance with examples.>

## Conventions

| Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|
| <rule> | <why> |

## Do / Do Not

| Do | Do not |
|---|---|
| <do> | <do not> |

## Checklist Before Opening a PR

- [ ] <verifiable item>
````

### Skill skeleton

`name` must equal the `skills/<dir>/` directory name.

````markdown
---
name: "<dir>"
description: "Use when <trigger>. Triggers include \"<keyword>\", \"<keyword>\"."
---
# <Skill title>

## When to invoke

- "<paraphrase a request that should load this skill>"

## <Substantive procedure>

<A checklist, table, or numbered steps — the operational core.>

## Output template

```markdown
<the shape the skill produces>
```

## Quality gate

- [ ] <objective pass/fail check>
````

### Hook skeleton

Flat file `hooks/<name>.json`, with the referenced script in `hooks/<name>/` and marked executable.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": ".github/hooks/<name>/<script>.sh",
        "cwd": ".",
        "env": { "MODE": "block" },
        "timeoutSec": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## How the standard is enforced

- The **`copilot-primitives`** job in [`workflows/spec-quality.yml`](workflows/spec-quality.yml) runs [`scripts/validate-copilot-primitives.py`](scripts/validate-copilot-primitives.py): frontmatter schemas, `prompt -> agent` and `handoff -> agent` integrity, one H1, a single trailing newline, relative-link resolution under `.github/`, banned pragmas, banned tooling, stale paths, and the required body sections above.
- The **`markdown-lint`** job runs the root [`../.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`](../.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc); **`spec-traceability`** and **`legacy-traceability`** enforce REQ-ID and `source_legacy` coverage.
- That config disables `MD025` and `MD040` among others, so do not conflate the two gates: "exactly one H1" fails the primitive validator (never markdownlint), and "every fence declares a language" is a review convention, not a lint failure.
- Every recurring mistake earns a named guardrail in code or CI and, when it changes a durable decision, an ADR. Facilitator postmortems and answer material stay outside this public repository.

Reference implementations to copy from: [`agents/archaeologist.agent.md`](agents/archaeologist.agent.md), [`prompts/stage-archaeologist-extract-business-rules.prompt.md`](prompts/stage-archaeologist-extract-business-rules.prompt.md), [`skills/ears-validate/SKILL.md`](skills/ears-validate/SKILL.md), and [`instructions/modular-monolith.instructions.md`](instructions/modular-monolith.instructions.md).

## Authoring checklist

- [ ] The primitive is in the right folder with the right suffix (`.agent.md`, `.prompt.md`, `.instructions.md`, `SKILL.md`, or a flat `hooks/<name>.json`).
- [ ] Frontmatter uses only valid keys, with no retired (`infer`, `mode`) or invented (`tested_with`) keys, and a skill `name` that equals its directory.
- [ ] All required body sections are present, in order.
- [ ] Exactly one H1, no skipped heading levels, every fence has a language, one trailing newline, and no markdownlint pragma.
- [ ] Every convention cites its authoritative document; no invented SIFAP facts; no banned tooling; English, no emojis.
- [ ] Every relative link resolves on disk.
- [ ] `python3 .github/scripts/validate-copilot-primitives.py` and `npx markdownlint-cli2 "<file>"` both report zero issues.
