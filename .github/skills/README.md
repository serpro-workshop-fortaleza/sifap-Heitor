# Skills Index

This directory contains the GitHub Copilot Agent Skills for the workshop — **42** in total, each in its own `<name>/SKILL.md`.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot discovers `SKILL.md` files under `.github/skills/<name>/` and auto-loads a skill by semantically matching your request against its `description`. That matching is invisible to people, which is what this index is for. The descriptions below are load-bearing: each states *when to use* the skill, so keep them accurate.

## Maintenance Rule

- The `name:` in a `SKILL.md` **must exactly equal its parent directory name** (lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens; 64 characters max) or Copilot silently fails to load the skill.
- Only `name` and `description` are valid frontmatter keys; any other key (for example `license`, `allowed-tools`, `compatibility`, or `metadata`) fails the `copilot-primitives` gate.
- `description` is capped at **1024 characters** and must state *when to use* the skill, because it is the only signal Copilot uses to auto-load it.
- Every skill body needs, in order: `## When to invoke`, a substantive procedure section, `## Output template`, and `## Quality gate`.
- The full schema and section contract live in [`../PRIMITIVE-STANDARD.md`](../PRIMITIVE-STANDARD.md) and are enforced by [`../scripts/validate-copilot-primitives.py`](../scripts/validate-copilot-primitives.py). When you add a skill, add its row to the matching group above and keep the total count current.
