# Pipeline hardening

## When to invoke

- "Harden our GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps / GitLab pipeline."
- "Migrate from long-lived secrets to OIDC."
- "Achieve SLSA Level 2/3."
- "Sign our container images."

## Threat model (short list)

1. **Stolen secrets** from pipeline logs or a compromised runner.
2. **Malicious dependency** published upstream or through typosquatting.
3. **Compromised third-party GitHub Action or shared step**.
4. **Tampered artifact** between build and deployment.
5. **Privilege escalation** caused by overly broad pipeline permissions.

## Controls (ordered by ROI)

### Tier 1 — do first

- [ ] **OIDC for the cloud**: do not store long-lived cloud credentials as secrets. Use federated identity with short-lived tokens.
- [ ] **Pin third-party actions by SHA**, not by tag (`actions/checkout@<sha>` with a comment showing the version).
- [ ] A **`permissions:` block** in every workflow, defaulting to `contents: read` and elevated only where needed.
- [ ] **Branch protection**: required reviews, required status checks, no force pushes, and signed commits on main.
- [ ] **Secret scanning + push protection** enabled across the organization.
- [ ] **Dependabot / Renovate** for dependencies and actions.

### Tier 2 — supply chain integrity

- [ ] **SBOM** generated for every build (Syft / CycloneDX).
- [ ] **Artifact signing** with Cosign (keyless via OIDC preferred).
- [ ] **Provenance** (SLSA v1.0 attestation) published with the artifact.
- [ ] **Verify signatures during deployment**: the deployment job rejects unsigned artifacts.
- [ ] **Vulnerability scanning** (Trivy / Grype) on the image; fail on Critical/High findings unless exceptions are justified.

### Tier 3 — mature

- [ ] **Hermetic / reproducible builds** where feasible.
- [ ] **Two-person review** for release pipelines.
- [ ] **Runner hardening**: ephemeral, restricted network egress, and no shared mutable state.

## Anti-patterns

- Storing `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` as repository secrets when OIDC is available.
- `permissions: write-all`.
- Floating `@main` or `@v3` tags in third-party actions.
- Deploying an artifact built in another pipeline without verifying its signature.
- Secrets printed in logs through unquoted shell expansion.

## Output template

```markdown
## Pipeline hardening report - <workflow or repo>

| Control | Status | Evidence / gap |
|---|---|---|
| OIDC for cloud auth | done / missing | <link or note> |
| Actions pinned by SHA | done / missing | <count of floating tags> |
| Least-privilege permissions | done / missing | <workflows missing the block> |
| SBOM + artifact signing | done / missing | <tool> |
| Provenance (SLSA) | Level 0/1/2/3 | <attestation link> |

**Target SLSA level**: <N>
**Blocking gaps**: <count>
```

## Quality gate

- [ ] No long-lived cloud secrets remain; cloud auth uses OIDC federation.
- [ ] Every third-party action is pinned by commit SHA, not a floating tag.
- [ ] Every workflow declares a least-privilege `permissions:` block (default `contents: read`).
- [ ] Release artifacts are signed and their signatures are verified at deploy time.
- [ ] Secret scanning, push protection, and dependency updates are enabled.
