# Safe schema migration

## When to invoke

- "Plan the migration to add column X."
- "Can we rename this column without downtime?"
- "How do we remove this table safely?"

## Expand / migrate / contract pattern

Every schema change that affects live traffic goes through **three deployments**, never just one.

1. **Expand** - add the new shape alongside the old one (new nullable column, new table, new index). No reads or writes use it yet.
2. **Migrate** - dual-write to the old and new shapes, backfill historical rows, and switch reads to the new shape behind a flag.
3. **Contract** - remove the old shape only after the new shape has been authoritative for at least one release cycle.

## Practical rules

- **Additive changes are always safe**: new nullable column, new index (CONCURRENTLY / ONLINE), new table.
- **Destructive changes never happen in a single deployment**: drop column, rename column, change type, drop table, add NOT NULL.
- **Backfills run in batches** with LIMIT, pauses between batches, and idempotency. Never run `UPDATE whole_table SET …` all at once.
- **Index construction**: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (Postgres), `ONLINE=ON` (MySQL 8 / SQL Server). Watch for lock escalation.
- **Renames**: DO NOT rename in place. Add a new column → dual-write → backfill → switch reads → remove the old column.

## Pre-flight checklist

- [ ] The migration has written **forward** and **rollback** plans.
- [ ] Duration estimated on a **production copy** (never estimate in development).
- [ ] Lock impact assessed (`pg_locks`, `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`, `sys.dm_tran_locks`).
- [ ] Backfill batch size selected based on the replication-lag budget.
- [ ] Monitoring installed for replica lag, long-running transactions, and deadlocks.
- [ ] Feature flag or dual-read path installed before the migrate stage.

## Red flags - do not ship

- A single `ALTER TABLE` that takes a full lock on a large table.
- A migration coupled to the application deployment that cannot be rolled back independently.
- An irreversible step without a backup.
- A backfill that rewrites every row in one transaction.

## Output template

```markdown
## Migration plan - <change>

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Change type | additive / destructive |
| Pattern stage | Expand / Migrate / Contract |
| Migration file | backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V<N>__<desc>.sql |
| Forward plan | <DDL / backfill> |
| Rollback plan | <how to reverse independently of the app deploy> |
| Lock impact | <estimate from a production copy> |

### Backfill
- Batch size <rows>, pause <ms>, idempotent yes/no
```

## Quality gate

- [ ] Destructive changes are split across expand / migrate / contract deployments.
- [ ] Forward and rollback plans exist and are independent of the app deployment.
- [ ] Indexes are built with `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`; no full-table lock ships.
- [ ] Backfills run in bounded, idempotent batches within the replication-lag budget.
- [ ] Duration and lock impact were estimated on a production-sized copy.
