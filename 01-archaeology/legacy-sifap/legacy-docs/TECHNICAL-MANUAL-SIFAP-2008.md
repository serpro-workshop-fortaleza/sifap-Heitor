> This is a reconstructed historical document for the SIFAP 2.0 workshop archaeology exercise. It simulates Technical Manual version 2.3.1 (2008), as it would have been produced by the SUPDE/DESIF team. Period language and the names of people, units, and procedures have been intentionally preserved. **This document must not be used as the system's current specification.** Sections marked `[TO BE COMPLETED]` and internal comments about outdated information are part of the exercise—they represent real documentation gaps the team must investigate.

## 2. System Architecture

<!-- NOTE: This section has not been updated since 2008 -->

### 2.1. Technological Platform

The SIFAP is developed and run in the organization's mainframe environment, using the following platform:

| Component | Version | Observations |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Natural** | 6.3.12 | Development language - updated in 2005 (migration from v4.2) |
| **Adabas** | 7.4.3 | DBMS - updated in 2005 (migration from v6.1) |
| **Com\*plete** | 6.3.1 | Teleprocessing monitor for 3270 screens |
| **JES2** | z/OS 1.8 | Batch job entry subsystem |
| **CICS** | TS 3.1 | Used only for integration with query transaction CPF (Federal Revenue) |
| **z/OS** | 1.8 | Mainframe Operating System |

### 2.2. Natural Library Structure

The SIFAP objects are organized in the Natural **SIFAP** library, as follows:

```
SIFAP Library
├── Programs (executable programs)
├── Subprograms (routines called by CALLNAT)
├── Copycodes (code blocks included via INCLUDE)
├── Maps (3270 screens - input/output maps)
├── DDMs (Data Definition Modules - access to Adabas)
├── LDAs (Local Data Areas)
└── GDAs (Global Data Areas)
```

### 2.3. Data Model

The SIFAP uses **3 main DDMs** in the Adabas:

| DDM | File (FNR) | Description |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| BENEFICIARY | FNR 150 | Beneficiary registration |
| SOCIAL-PROGRAM | FNR 151 | Parameters of social programs |
| PAYMENT | FNR 152 | Payment records |

<!-- NOTE: The DDM AUDIT (FNR 153), created in 2005 during the migration to
 Natural 6.3, not included in this section as it was added after writing
 beginning of this chapter. Check with Roberto Carlos for update. -->

> **Technical note:** The detailed description of the fields of each DDM can be found in the DBA Operation Manual (MO-SIFAP-DBA-2007). The FDTs (Field Definition Tables) are under the responsibility of DBA Cláudia Regina dos Santos.
