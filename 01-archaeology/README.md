# Stage 1 — Archaeology

> **Track:** [Team Kit](../README.md) › **Stage 1 — Archaeology**

**Stage 1 overview.** Read this page before opening the GUIDE; it presents the objective, expected artifacts, and participants.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Target audience** | All 5 team pairs |
| **Prerequisites** | None — this is the starting point |
| **Estimated time** | 90 min (11:00–12:00 + 13:30–14:00) |
| **Stage** | Stage 1 — Archaeology |
| **Expected outcome** | Rules catalog, dependency map, glossary, and discovery report |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Read first:** [`LEGACY-EXPLORATION-CHECKLIST.md`](LEGACY-EXPLORATION-CHECKLIST.md) — mandatory gate before starting Stage 2. No EARS requirement is accepted without traceability to legacy code.

> [!TIP]
> **The system is running, not just archived.** The same data you are about to study can be queried through the shared viewer terminal at <https://sifap-lab-438k30.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com/terminal/>. Sign in as `viewer` with the password shared privately by the facilitator. Reading the source is still the gate; the live screen only makes the evidence concrete.

## What Stage 1 is

**Software archaeology** is the practice of extracting knowledge from legacy systems by systematically reading source code without modifying it. In this workshop, archaeology has a precise objective: gather enough evidence to write traceable requirements in Stage 2.

SIFAP, the Payment Inspection and Administration System, has operated for 29 years. Most knowledge about its business rules is in the Natural code, not in documentation. Without reading the code, the team would write specifications based on assumptions—which CI rejects because it requires a valid `source_legacy:`.

## Where this fits in the workshop flow

![Day timeline: pre-event, 4 stages, and demo, with the three H1, H2, and H3 handoffs](../assets/timeline-stages.svg)

## Who works here

All 5 pairs work in parallel, each responsible for 3 Natural programs. Pair 1 (Vision) leads the synthesis at the end of the stage. See [`GUIDE.md`](GUIDE.md) for the full assignment.

## Stage 1 artifacts

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`LEGACY-EXPLORATION-CHECKLIST.md`](LEGACY-EXPLORATION-CHECKLIST.md) | **Mandatory gate.** Program ownership by pair and completion criteria before Stage 2. |
| [`GUIDE.md`](GUIDE.md) | Step-by-step guide with a timed schedule. |
| [`glossary.md`](glossary.md) | Glossary of SIFAP domain terms and abbreviations. |
| [`business-rules-catalog.md`](business-rules-catalog.md) | Catalog of extracted business rules with mandatory `Source Program`. |
| [`dependency-map.md`](dependency-map.md) | Dependency map between programs and DDMs. |
| [`discovery-report.md`](discovery-report.md) | Discovery report consolidating the stage evidence. |
| [`mysteries-checklist.md`](mysteries-checklist.md) | Traceability checklist for open questions. |
| [`mysteries-found.md`](mysteries-found.md) | Detailed record of open questions with evidence and owner. |

The legacy code is in [`legacy-sifap/`](legacy-sifap/) (shared by the kit).

The shared Azure lab is operated outside this repository. Participants do not receive deployment or administration material; use the read-only viewer described in [`docs/legacy-system-access.md`](../docs/legacy-system-access.md).
