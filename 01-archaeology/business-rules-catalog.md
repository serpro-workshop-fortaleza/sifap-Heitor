# Business Rules Catalog — Legacy SIFAP

> **Track:** [Team Kit](../README.md) › [Stage 1](README.md) › **Business Rules Catalog**

**Artifact completed by the team during Stage 1.** Each pair extracts rules from its assigned `.NSN` programs and records them here with mandatory traceability to the source program.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Target audience** | All pairs—each pair completes its program section |
| **Prerequisites** | Read the assigned `.NSN` programs |
| **Stage** | Stage 1 — Archaeology |
| **Expected outcome** | Catalog with `Source Program` completed for every candidate rule |

> [!NOTE]
> Each rule cites the source program with a line range (`file.NSN:Lstart-Lend`) and is classified as **Confirmed** (corroborated by historical documentation in `legacy-sifap/legacy-docs/`), **Inferred** (from code only), or **Mystery** (an open question—also record it in [`mysteries-found.md`](mysteries-found.md) with `path:line` evidence, an unconfirmed hypothesis, owner, and status).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Step-by-step guide: [`GUIDE.md`](GUIDE.md).
