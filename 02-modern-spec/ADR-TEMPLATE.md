## Concept: ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

An ADR is the formal record of a significant architectural decision. It documents the context that led to the decision, the alternatives assessed, the selected option, and the expected consequences.

**Why it matters:** technical decisions made verbally during the workshop get lost. A two-page ADR ensures that any PR reviewer understands why the system was designed in a particular way, without asking the person who made the decision at 14:30 on a busy day.

**Golden rule:** always list the "path not taken." Without it, the ADR becomes an implementation description rather than a decision record.

**When to create one:** only when the decision blocks `plan.md`. If the decision fits in a commit comment, it does not need an ADR.

<summary><strong>Completed example — ADR-001: database for SIFAP 2.0</strong></summary>

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-05-10 |
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Decision-makers** | Pair 2 (Enterprise Architect + Software Architect) |
| **Related feature** | `specs/001-pagamento-beneficio/` |

**Context:** The legacy SIFAP (Payment Inspection and Administration System) uses Adabas, a navigational database. The modernization needs a relational database compatible with JPA/Hibernate and supported by the operations team.

**Options:**

- PostgreSQL 16: open source, JSONB support, and Testcontainers available.
- MySQL 8: broad support, but less adoption in Brazilian government environments.

**Decision:** PostgreSQL 16.

**Rationale:** Established adoption in public-sector systems, native support for advanced types (JSONB for variable DDM fields), and Testcontainers integration without an additional license.

**Positive consequences:** Testcontainers simplifies integration testing. **Negative consequences:** The DBA team needs familiarity with PostgreSQL.
