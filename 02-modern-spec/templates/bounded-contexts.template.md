## Concept: Bounded Context

A bounded context is an explicit boundary within which a domain model is valid and consistent. The term comes from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and provides the foundation for defining the modules of a Modular Monolith.

**Why it matters:** in SIFAP, the payments module uses the term "beneficiary" in one way, while the inspection module may use the same term with different rules. Defining bounded contexts prevents a single model from being distorted to serve every context at once, which causes unwanted coupling and makes evolution difficult.

**Modular Monolith:** an architecture in which bounded contexts are independent Java modules within a single JVM. Each module has its own layers (`domain/`, `application/`, `infrastructure/`) and communicates with other modules only through defined public interfaces.

**Strangler Fig:** an incremental migration pattern in which the modern system grows around the legacy system and replaces features one at a time. SIFAP 2.0 does not need to replace everything at once. Each bounded context can be modernized independently.

> Definition of Done: hypotheses assessed, rejections documented, 2 to 5 contexts named, and the Mermaid diagram renders without errors.
