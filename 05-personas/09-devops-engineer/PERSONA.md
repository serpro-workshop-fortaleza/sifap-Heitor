## What this persona is

The DevOps Engineer owns the path from a code commit to something that runs reliably. In the SIFAP (Payment Inspection and Administration System) modernization, this persona ensures that any team machine can start the local environment in under 60 seconds, GitHub Actions validates every PR with linting, tests, and image builds, and Terraform describes the target Azure topology even when it is not applied during the workshop.

Why it matters: a fragile pipeline or ambiguous local environment creates friction for every pair. The Developer loses time to environment errors, the QA Engineer lacks a stable test foundation, and the final demonstration risks operational rather than functional failure.

Within the Agentic Legacy Modernization framework, the DevOps Engineer works with the Deployment Agent in Stage 4 and the Security Agent in Stage 3, configuring infrastructure for continuous deployment and coexistence between legacy and modern systems.

| Stage | Responsibility | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Archaeology** | Validate local tools and plan what the prototype needs for local execution | Validated work environment |
| **2 — Specification** | Write the deployment strategy ADR (ADR 005) and participate in infrastructure design | ADR 005 + Terraform draft |
| **3 — Implementation** | Maintain GitHub Actions for builds and tests, publish Docker images, and maintain Terraform | Green pipeline + valid `terraform plan` |
| **4 — Evolution** | Validate Copilot Agent PRs that change the pipeline or infrastructure | Pipeline remains green after the Agent |

## Core responsibility

Reproducible builds, a green pipeline, and infrastructure described as code. In the workshop: documented local execution that starts the application and database in under 60 seconds once the prototype exists, CI that checks linting, tests, and image builds, and an error-free `terraform plan`.

## Key skills

- GitHub Actions: CI/CD workflows, dependency caching, Docker image builds
- Terraform (Azure provider ~> 3.x): modules by service area (networking, compute, database, monitoring)
- Docker and Docker Compose: Maven dependency caching, slim final image, and health checks
- Minimum observability: structured JSON logs, `/actuator/health`, and basic metrics
- Secret management: Azure Key Vault and CI environment variables, never code or versioned `.env`

## Persona kit

| Artifact | Path | Use |
|---|---|---|
| DevOps Engineer agent | `.github/agents/devops-engineer.agent.md` | CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and incident analysis |
| Prompt `/pipeline` | `.github/prompts/persona-devops-engineer-pipeline.prompt.md` | Create or improve a GitHub Actions workflow |
| Prompt `/iac-module` | `.github/prompts/persona-devops-engineer-iac-module.prompt.md` | Create a Terraform module for an Azure service |
| Prompt `/incident-rca` | `.github/prompts/persona-devops-engineer-incident-rca.prompt.md` | Incident root-cause analysis |
| CI/CD instructions | `.github/instructions/cicd.instructions.md` | Mandatory pipeline conventions |
| Infrastructure instructions | `.github/instructions/infrastructure.instructions.md` | Mandatory IaC conventions |

## Copilot tools and modes

| Tool / Mode | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Copilot Ask** | Generate GitHub Actions workflows and understand CI errors |
| **Copilot Plan** | Create Terraform modules in batches and plan multi-file infrastructure changes |
| **Copilot Agent** | Stage 4—long, multi-step CI chains |
| **Azure / Terraform MCP** (if enabled) | Inspect Azure resources and Terraform state |
| **Spec-Kit** (`/speckit.taskstoissues`) | Create operational Issues from tasks |

## Recommended cheat sheets

- [`09-cheat-sheets/spec-kit-workflow.md`](../../09-cheat-sheets/spec-kit-workflow.md) — `/speckit.taskstoissues`, `/speckit.analyze`, and release handoff
- [`09-cheat-sheets/copilot-3-modes.md`](../../09-cheat-sheets/copilot-3-modes.md) — use Agent for pipelines with many sequential steps

## How to perform well

- [ ] **Start the local environment in under 60 seconds.** Once the prototype exists: application + database with one command.
- [ ] **Require lint + test + image build on `main`.** None of these steps is optional.
- [ ] **Keep `terraform plan` error-free.** Even when it is not applied that day.
- [ ] **Add structured logs and health checks in Stage 3.** Do not leave them for Stage 4.

## Common mistakes and how to avoid them

| Symptom | Cause | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| Team loses an hour at startup | Ambiguous or undocumented local setup | Document the exact startup command before Stage 3 |
| CI runs only unit tests | Pipeline scope is too narrow | Include image build and linting from the first version |
| Terraform has 500 lines and unclear output | Monolithic module | Use one module per Azure service area |
| Real secret in a versioned `.env` | Early convenience | Store secrets only in Azure Key Vault or CI variables; add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately |

## Combinations with other personas

| Combination | Note |
|---|---|
| **DevOps + DBA** | Manage PostgreSQL and the Terraform module that provisions it |
| **DevOps + Tech Writer** | In Stage 4, monitor the Agent while the Tech Writer documents the runbook |

## Ready-to-use prompts

1. **(Ask)** _"Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` GitHub Actions workflow that runs on push, configures Java 21 with Maven caching, runs tests, and builds a Docker image."_
2. **(Plan)** _"Plan the backend Dockerfile: Maven dependency caching, a smaller final image, and a health check."_
3. **(Ask)** _"The local environment takes 3 minutes to start. Analyze the files created by the team and propose 3 optimizations."_

## Emergency defaults

| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| Local environment does not start | Checklist: (1) Is Docker Desktop running? (2) Are ports 5432/8080/3000 free? (3) Are environment variables set? (4) Do logs show the root cause? |
| CI fails | Read GitHub Actions logs—the most common error is the wrong Java version or a cache miss |
| `terraform plan` fails | Check: (1) Did `terraform init` run? (2) Is the provider version compatible? (3) Are required variables set? |
| GitHub Actions is unfamiliar | Copy `.github/workflows/build.yml` and adapt it |

## Dependencies

| Persona | Relationship | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Lead | You depend on them | Stable build for the pipeline |
| Enterprise Architect | You depend on them | Topology for Terraform |
| Developer | Depends on you | Documented local environment, green CI |
| DBA | Depends on you for infrastructure | Provisioned PostgreSQL |
| QA Engineer | Depends on you | Pipeline that runs tests |

## How you are evaluated

- **Rubric A3 — Technical Integrity:** local execution works, CI is green
- **Rubric A4 — Copilot:** Agent used for multi-step pipelines
- **Criterion:** reproducible build—any team machine runs the documented local environment in under 60 seconds
