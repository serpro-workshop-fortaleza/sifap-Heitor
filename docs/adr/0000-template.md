<summary><strong>Completed example — ADR-0001: Adopt Flyway for database migrations</strong></summary>

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-05-12 |
| **Authors** | DBA — Carla Souza |
| **Supersedes** | N/A |

### Context

The legacy SIFAP uses Adabas, a non-relational database. The modernization adopts PostgreSQL 16. We need a controlled schema-evolution strategy that tracks changes, supports recovery after errors, and integrates with CI. Program `SIFAP-PAGTO.NSN` (lines 45–78) reveals that the monthly payment cycle requires at least three schema transformations over time.

### Decision

We will adopt Flyway as the migration tool. Each schema change will be represented by a version-controlled `V<N>__description.sql` file in the repository. CI will run `mvn flyway:migrate` on every pull request to `develop`.

### Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Why it was rejected |
|---|---|
| Liquibase | More verbose XML format and a steeper learning curve for the team during this workshop |
| Manual migrations | No traceability, automated rollback, or CI integration |

### Consequences

- Easier: complete traceability of schema changes; CI validates them before merge.
- Harder: migration files are immutable after merge; every correction requires a new file.
- Risks: accidentally editing an applied migration breaks Flyway.
- Mitigations: branch protection on `develop` plus the rule documented in `troubleshooting.md`.
