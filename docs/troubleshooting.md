## Setup and environment

### Missing local tools (Java, Node, Maven)

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | A "command not found" error message for `java`, `node`, or `mvn` |
| **Likely cause** | The local tools have not been installed yet |
| **Fix** | Install the versions specified in [`00-SETUP.md`](../00-SETUP.md), then validate them with `java -version`, `node --version`, and `git --version` |
| **How to confirm** | All three commands return the expected version without errors |

### "git: command not found" in the VS Code terminal (Mac)

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | An error occurs when you try to run any `git` command |
| **Likely cause** | The Xcode CLI tools are not installed |
| **Fix** | Run `xcode-select --install` and follow the installer |
| **How to confirm** | `git --version` returns a version without errors |

---

## Copilot, agents, and personas

### Slash command does not appear in Chat

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | `/ears-convert`, `/tdd`, or other commands do not appear in the suggestions |
| **Likely cause** | VS Code has not reloaded the consolidated `.github/` directory, or the window was opened outside the repository root |
| **Fix** | Confirm that `.github/prompts/` contains files, then reload the window: `Cmd+Shift+P` → _Developer: Reload Window_ |
| **How to confirm** | Commands appear when you type `/` in Chat |

> [!CAUTION]
> Never create parallel copies of agents, prompts, or skills outside `.github/`. It is the only active source and must not be edited.

### "I can't select `@archaeologist` in Chat"

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | The `@archaeologist` agent does not appear in the Chat selector |
| **Cause 1** | The `06-stage-agents/` directory is not in the workspace |
| **Cause 2** | The GitHub Copilot Chat extension is out of date |
| **Fix** | Run `ls 06-stage-agents/` to confirm that the directory is present. Update the extension from the VS Code Extensions view |
| **How to confirm** | The agent appears in the Chat dropdown |

### Copilot responds without the relevant context

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Generic responses unrelated to SIFAP (Payment Inspection and Administration System) or the current stage |
| **Likely cause** | No stage agent is selected, or the wrong agent is selected |
| **Fix** | Confirm the current stage with the team and select the corresponding agent from the Chat dropdown |
| **How to confirm** | Responses begin referencing the stage and legacy-system context |

### "I want to use Plan mode, but only Ask is available"

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Plan mode is not available |
| **Likely cause** | The Copilot extension is outdated |
| **Fix** | Update the GitHub Copilot Chat extension in VS Code |
| **How to confirm** | Plan mode appears in the mode selector |

---

## Spec-Kit and EARS

### "`specify version` returns command not found"

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | An error occurs when you run any `specify` command |
| **Likely cause** | Spec-Kit is not installed |
| **Fix** | Run the commands below |
| **How to confirm** | `specify version` returns a version number |

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
specify version
```

### CI rejected the PR: `missing source_legacy`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | CI blocks the pull request with a traceability error |
| **Likely cause** | One or more EARS requirements do not include a `source_legacy:` line |
| **Fix** | Open `specs/<NNN>-<feature>/spec.md`, locate REQ-IDs without `source_legacy:`, and add the field, pointing to `01-archaeology/legacy-sifap/...#L<linha>` or marking it as `[GREENFIELD] <motivo>` |
| **How to confirm** | CI passes on the next run |

See [`07-concepts/05-ears-notation.md`](../07-concepts/05-ears-notation.md) for the correct format.

### `/speckit.clarify` is asking too many questions

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | The command asks 10 or more questions |
| **Cause** | This is not a problem — it is the expected behavior |
| **Action** | Answer every question. Each answer helps prevent a future bug |

---

## Backend — Java and Spring Boot

### Backend does not start — Postgres connection error

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | A `Connection refused` or similar error occurs when the backend starts |
| **Likely cause** | Postgres is not running, or the URL in `application.yml` is incorrect |
| **Fix** | Check `application.yml` and start Postgres using the method defined by the team (local, Testcontainers, or Docker Compose) |
| **How to confirm** | The backend starts and responds at `/actuator/health` |

### Flyway: `Migration checksum mismatch`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | A Flyway error occurs when the backend starts |
| **Likely cause** | An existing migration file was edited after it was applied |
| **Fix** | Restore the original version using `git log` and create a new `V<N+1>__descricao.sql` file |
| **How to confirm** | The backend starts without Flyway errors |

> [!CAUTION]
> Never edit migration files that have already been applied (V1, V2, V3...). Always create a new file with the next version number.

### Testcontainers: `Could not find a valid Docker environment`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Tests that use Testcontainers fail with a Docker environment error |
| **Likely cause** | Docker is not running, or the socket uses a nonstandard path |
| **Fix (macOS)** | `export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock` or `export TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE=/var/run/docker.sock` |
| **How to confirm** | The tests pass on the next run |

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | A module-not-found error occurs when the frontend starts |
| **Likely cause** | Dependencies are not installed |
| **Fix** | `cd frontend && npm install` |
| **How to confirm** | The frontend starts without module errors |

---

## Docker

### `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Every Docker command fails with a daemon error |
| **Likely cause** | Docker Desktop is stopped |
| **Fix** | Open Docker Desktop and wait for the service to start completely |
| **How to confirm** | `docker ps` returns the container list without errors |

### `port is already allocated`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | The container does not start because of a port conflict |
| **Likely cause** | Port 5432, 8080, or 3000 is already in use by another process |
| **Fix** | Run `lsof -i :8080` to identify and stop the process, or change the port in the local configuration |
| **How to confirm** | The container starts without a port error |

### Docker Desktop reports `Out of memory`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Containers fail or become slow, and a memory warning appears |
| **Likely cause** | The RAM limit allocated to Docker Desktop is too low |
| **Fix** | Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory → 8 GB or more |
| **How to confirm** | Containers start and respond normally |

---

## Git and GitHub

### Push rejected: `protected branch`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | `git push` is rejected with a protected-branch message |

| **Fix** | Create a branch and open a pull request. See [`00-GIT-WORKFLOW.md`](../00-GIT-WORKFLOW.md) |
| **How to confirm** | The pull request is created successfully |

### Merge conflict

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | `<<<<<<<` markers appear in files during a merge or rebase |
| **Likely cause** | Someone changed the same file in `develop` before you |
| **Fix** | Run the block below, resolve the conflicts manually, and complete the rebase |
| **How to confirm** | `git status` no longer shows files with conflicts |

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop
# Resolve conflicts in files containing markers
git add <file>
git rebase --continue
```

### Commit accidentally made directly on `develop`

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git stash
git checkout -b nova-branch
git stash pop
git commit -m "..."
```

### `gh: command not found`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | An error occurs when you use any `gh` command |
| **Likely cause** | GitHub CLI is not installed |
| **Fix** | `brew install gh && gh auth login` |
| **How to confirm** | `gh --version` returns a version without errors |

---

## Terraform and Azure

### `Error: building AzureRM Client`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | Terraform fails while initializing the Azure provider |
| **Likely cause** | The Azure CLI session has expired or has not been started |
| **Fix** | Run `az login` |
| **How to confirm** | `terraform plan` runs without authentication errors |

### `terraform plan` shows hundreds of new resources

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Symptom** | The `plan` output lists many resources to create |
| **Cause** | The state file is empty — this is the expected behavior on the first run |
| **Action** | Review the plan. Do not run `apply`. |

> [!CAUTION]
> The workshop authorizes only `terraform plan`. Running `terraform apply` creates real Azure resources and immediately incurs costs.

---

## Plan B — Copilot outage

If Copilot Chat stops responding for more than 5 minutes:

> [!WARNING]
> Do not wait passively. The workshop lasts 8 hours, and every idle minute has a high cost for the team.

- [ ] **Reload** — try `Cmd+Shift+P` → _Reload Window_. If Copilot returns, continue as usual.
- [ ] **Work manually** — if it remains offline, return to the templates and artifacts the team has already produced.
- [ ] **Structure the next artifact** — use the available evidence without inventing data.
- [ ] **Document it in the PR** — write: _"Completed manually in X min (Copilot offline)"_ — this supports the Stage 4 report.
- [ ] **Coordinate with the receiving partner** — agree that the artifact may be less refined than usual.

CI continues to validate changes even while Copilot is offline. Work does not stop.

| Artifact without Copilot | Next step |
|---|---|
| EARS in Stage 2 | Use the traceable findings and the [Spec-Kit](../09-cheat-sheets/spec-kit-workflow.md) workflow |
| ADR in Stage 2 | Complete the [ADR template](adr/0000-template.md) |
| Implementation in Stage 3 | Review the prioritized EARS requirements, the DDMs, and the team's decisions |
| Issue for Agent in Stage 4 | Write the context, acceptance criteria, and change traceability |

---

## When none of the solutions above work

| Time blocked | Action |
|---|---|
| 5 min | Read the error again carefully. Use Copilot Ask: _"What does this error mean: `<paste the error>`"_ |
| 10 min | Ask your partner |
| 20 min | Raise your hand for the facilitator (TEAM-FLOW §6 rule) |
| 30 min | Pause this task and work on another one while someone helps |
